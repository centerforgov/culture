#Diagnosing Culture

There is [a culture diagnostic tool](http://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=559077c25e9d9768f68b4570&assetKey=AS%3A271750183489537%401441801700739) developed by Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn in 2006. It essentially states there are four type of organizational cultures, which exist along a *competing values framewor*. The competing values are:
* Flexibility & Discretion vs. Stability & Control
* Internal Focus & Integration vs. External Focus & Differentiation

Using these values, Cameron and Quinn group organizations into four cultural categories depending on their results:
* **Clan Culture:** collaborative, friendly, teamwork abounds, colleagues are like family, leaders are mentors, emphsasizes loyalty, tradition, cohesion and concern for people. 
* **Adhocracy Culture:** creative, dynamic, entrepaneurial, cutting edge, risk-taking, initiative and freedom are encouraged, being an industry leader is important
* **Market Culture:** competitive, results and goal oriented, hard-charging, productive, concerned with reuputation, success, and winning
* **Hierarchy Culture:** controlled, structured, formal, rules and prodecudered empasized, dependability, stablility, performance and efficient operations are prioritized

###First, identify the culture you want.
Many governments identify as a Hierarchy Culture and aspire to be different. But it is important to be specific and articulate what kind of culture you want, so the differences become clear. As you complete a diagnostic process, make note of the differences between the culture you have and the one you want. 

###Second, interview and observe.
  * Observe the common behaviors in your organization and ask others to observe them as well
    * Which behaviors contribute to your goals?
    * Which behaviors detract from your goals?
  * If you were performing at your best, which behaviors would be common? Which would be gone?
    * How would we treat residents differently?
    * How would employees exchange ideas with one another?
    * How would challenging issues get raised and resolved within the organization?
  * Notice what words people use when they describe the challenges and opportunities in their organization
    * Do they say “us” and “we” or do they say “they” or “them.” The latter may indicate a lack of ownership in both the problem and the solution. 
     * For example, do people talk as if “data” is someone else’s domain, like the IT department?
    * Do they say “can’t” or “won’t” or “shouldn’t” more than they say “can” or “could” or “should?” These words choices indicate the level of risk aversion and innovation among employees. 
    * Do they more frequently talk about challenges than opportunities? Or is it the reverse?
    * Do they contribute to each other’s ideas or tear them down?
    * Do they talk about they way things used to be with nostalgia? Or do they talk about the way things could be with optimism?
    * Can they explain why they do certain activities or why your programs operate the way they do? Or do they punt those answers to a person higher in the organization?
  * Conduct interviews with employees at all levels of the organization—focus on those who were well respected, informally influential, and attuned to the organizations culture. 
  * Ask everyone who they consider the ultimate stakeholder. The differences in perspectives will reveal cultural disconnects and opportunities for alignment around a common mission and vision. 
  * Interview stakeholders about their perceptions of the organization? Ask them about their experiences as a “customer” and write down the common words they use to describe those experiences.   
    * Treat perceptions of the organization as facts
  * Identify the sub-cultures and micro-cultures through interviews and analyzing social media feedback and differences between component perceptions
  
###Fourth, consider how the following factors are influencing your culture:
  * Organizational Structure and Process
    * Centralization vs decentralization
    * Autonomy vs micro-management
    * Reporting structures and spans of control
    * Decision making processes
    * Information flows
  * People
    * Leaders
    * Managers
    * Front Lines
    * Customers
    * Stakeholders
  * Incentives
    * Compensation
    * Seniority
    * Recognition
    * Access
  * Performance Management 
    * Results/Evaluations
    * Feedback
    * Frequency
    * Remediation/Accountability
