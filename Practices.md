# Promote Core Practices and Behaviors, Not Just Values

When you diagnosed your culture, you identified practices and behaviors that contribute to your goals, and which are detracting. Create an awareness campaign for core practices and behaviors you want to see more of, highlighting how small but significant changes in behavior signal a shift in the right direction. For example, Chicago food inspectors are reducing food-borne illness by using data to identify high-risk restaurants for prioritized inspection. Celebrating their success internally is creating healthy competition inside the health department and signals that data-driven behaviors get rewarded. 

Find employees and programs, like the food inspectors, who are already exhibiting the desired practices and behaviors every day. Leverage them to teach and train your team on what success looks like when model behaviors are implemented. Focus on middle managers, who make and break culture. Give them direct feedback on specific opportunities to exhibit model behaviors. At the end of the day, employees change the culture more than the leaders, so leaders should acknowledge their own vulnerability, admitting they don’t always exhibit model behaviors but are willing to change themselves. 

**Communicating Success to Employees**

Even though employers and employees may differ in their personal definitions of success, there is general agreement that success is an important organizational value. The first step in getting on the same page about success is determining what success looks like to each group. Organizations commonly measure success by how well they have achieved their objectives or accomplished their mission. How do employees know if they are on the right path to the right destinations? How do they know their approaches are achieving results? This is where and when communication becomes important to engage employees, accelerating progress and productivity. A great organization will inform its employees about the progress it is making towards its goals. It will recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of its workers, and create opportunities to promote future success of its employees. If employers communicate with employees regularly and in an effective manner, employees are much more engaged and are incentivized to approach work with positive spirits and attitudes. This is true for all employees regardless of where they work and their type of work. Whether they are working for private companies, government entities, or not-for-profit organizations, they care about success, incentives, and recognition. Cities can communicate successes to their employees in a variety of ways:

* Recognizing Achievements
* Rewarding Accomplishments
* Documenting Success Stories
* Acknowledging Contributions
* Saying Thank You and Offering Praise for Excellent Service
* Providing Opportunities for Advancement

*Recognizing Achievements*
 
Invariably, employees everywhere respond positively to sincere recognition for a job well done. Let city employees know what they are doing well. Let them know their contributions are valued and recognize the important role they play in the city’s administration. Genuinely acknowledge employees’ extraordinary achievements by recognizing and celebrating their accomplishments. For instance, Denver has an employee recognition program that recognizes individuals and teams that exemplify “STARS” (Service, Teamwork, Accountability, Respect and Safety) values. This program celebrates employees who supported practices that deliver a world class city by achieving one or more of the city's goals.
 
Instead of remarking “well done” or “good job,” communicate specifically what employees have accomplished to merit the recognitions. For example, the human resources department of City of Daly, California initiated the “You are a star award” that recognizes employees for:

*performances that enhance efficiency and effectiveness of their departments
*going above and beyond their job descriptions to contribute to community service and development
*providing outstanding achievements over time
*exceptional participation in teams, special projects, and committees

A committee made up of employees representing various departments reviews nominations from coworkers and selects deserving awardees for public recognition. Awards range from a plaque, or write-up in the city’s employee newsletter (the Foghorn), to recognition at the city council meeting.
