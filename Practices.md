# Promote Core Practices and Behaviors, Not Just Values

When you diagnosed your culture, you identified practices and behaviors that contribute to your goals, and which are detracting. Create an awareness campaign for core practices and behaviors you want to see more of, highlighting how small but significant changes in behavior signal a shift in the right direction. For example, Chicago food inspectors are reducing food-borne illness by using data to identify high-risk restaurants for prioritized inspection. Celebrating their success internally is creating healthy competition inside the health department and signals that data-driven behaviors get rewarded. 

Find employees and programs, like the food inspectors, who are already exhibiting the desired practices and behaviors every day. Leverage them to teach and train your team on what success looks like when model behaviors are implemented. Focus on middle managers, who make and break culture. Give them direct feedback on specific opportunities to exhibit model behaviors. At the end of the day, employees change the culture more than the leaders, so leaders should acknowledge their own vulnerability, admitting they don’t always exhibit model behaviors but are willing to change themselves. 

**Communicating Success to Employees**

Even though employers and employees may differ in their personal definitions of success, there is general agreement that success is an important organizational value. The first step in getting on the same page about success is determining what success looks like to each group. Organizations commonly measure success by how well they have achieved their objectives or accomplished their mission. How do employees know if they are on the right path to the right destinations? How do they know their approaches are achieving results? This is where and when communication becomes important to engage employees, accelerating progress and productivity. A great organization will inform its employees about the progress it is making towards its goals. It will recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of its workers, and create opportunities to promote future success of its employees. If employers communicate with employees regularly and in an effective manner, employees are much more engaged and are incentivized to approach work with positive spirits and attitudes. This is true for all employees regardless of where they work and their type of work. Whether they are working for private companies, government entities, or not-for-profit organizations, they care about success, incentives, and recognition. Cities can communicate successes to their employees in a variety of ways:

* Recognizing Achievements
* Rewarding Accomplishments
* Documenting Success Stories
* Acknowledging Contributions
* Saying Thank You and Offering Praise for Excellent Service
* Providing Opportunities for Advancement

 *Documenting Success Stories*

Documenting success stories shows how the city is making a difference in the lives of its residents. Not only does telling stories about the positive changes the city is making reinforce public trust and confidence, but also it is an important way of communicating to employees that their efforts are making a positive difference. It is a powerful way to demonstrate to the public and stakeholders the value of the city administration to residents. There are a variety of ways to document success stories that could inspire both current and future employees to give off their best, including internal publication platforms such as magazines, newsletters, city’s website, videos, podcasts, etc. Pick the method that most suitably tells the city’s success stories to the public and employees as well. 

One of the ways Louisville, KY tells its success stories is by sharing the testimonials of their clients on its website. This provides a meaningful feedback to employees that their work are making impact and residents are appreciative.
