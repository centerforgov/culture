#Focus on the Ingredients

To change culture, don’t focus exclusively on it. In fact, don’t describe your efforts and interventions as “culture change.” Instead, focus on changing the factors, behaviors and conditions that affect and reinforce culture (i.e. people, incentives, structures). Make formal and informal changes to reach people on emotional and rational levels. Most organizations make the formal changes because they are easier to make, but informal changes can be even more effective and reinforce the formal signals:
